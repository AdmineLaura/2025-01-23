Docker containers have a lot of benefits: they are easy to build, they also work fast, and can work on any system like Windows, Linux, Mac, or Cloud platform.  

Docker helps system admins and developers automate, standardize, and speed up software delivery. It makes CI/CD simpler, more secure, and scalable. 

Docker integrates with popular CI/CD tools like: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, and AWS CodePipeline, making automation smoother.
